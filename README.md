# Wiley-Bibliometrics-Analysis
We are looking for methods to identify future leading authors in a specific scientific field.
# Data 
## Data Collection
The articles data is downloaded from Web of Science (core collection) under the topic of Biomaterials from 1990 to 2019 and saved as txt files.
[Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/products/web-of-science/)

[Concatenate the txt files to dataframe and keep the meaningful columns.](https://github.com/christine62/Wiley-Bibliometrics-Analysis/blob/master/code/concatwos.ipynb)
## Data Cleaning
Remove invalid records. The final dataset is saved in woscleaned.csv.
## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Impact Factor
**Impact Factor** is used to reflect the average number of citations divided by the total number of articles post on the journal recently. IF is frequently used as a proxy for relative importance of a journal.

## Pivot table of authors
Our research is about authors, we are trying to build the authors dataset. And considering timeliness, we will only keep authors who have publications from 2010 to 2017.

# Co-author network
**Co-author Directed Network**  
The Co-authorship network is formed if two authors(node) co-authoring an article together(edge). The edges are directed from the lead author to the other authors. 
The co-author network can detect the active authors and their partners and we can use it as a good indicator of potential author, also we will add network features in the prediction model.  
![alt text](https://github.com/christine62/Wiley-Bibliometrics-Analysis/blob/master/image/coauthor.png?raw=true)  
+ The authors with high centrality are always active corresponding authors. Itâ€™s a good indicator to consider their co-authorships to detect potential authors.  
+ As it is a directed network, the outdegree and indegree of a certain node, reflect the information about the times the author act as the first author and the number of the research participated in.
